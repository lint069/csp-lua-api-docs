import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Kbd } from "starlight-kbd/components";

Provides access to the configuration of a car's external cameras,
which are typically cycled using the <Kbd mac="F6" windows="F6" /> key.
It returns an `ac.CarCameraParams` object used to read or modify properties such as position, direction, and field of view.

<Aside type="note" title="Camera Count">
  To find out how many cameras are available for a specific vehicle, check the
  `car.carCamerasCount` property of an [`ac.StateCar`](../objects/state-car/)
  object.
</Aside>

## Usage Patterns

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Retrieval">

Access the first available external camera for the targeted car.

```lua
local camera = ac.accessCarCamera(0)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Description

The `ac.accessCarCamera` function allows scripts to dynamically alter the behavior of car-mounted cameras. This is frequently used for creating cinematic tools, custom replay angles, or adjusting the default "chase" views provided by the car's developer.

The returned object allows scripts to modify the camera’s position and orientation relative to the car,
adjust its field of view for cinematic effects, and fine-tune rendering parameters such as exposure and depth of field.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Adjusting FOV">

Retrieving the first camera and setting a wide-angle field of view.

```lua
local cam = ac.accessCarCamera(0)

if cam then
    -- set to a very wide 110-degree FOV
    cam.fov = 110
end
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Iterating Cameras">

Cycling through every camera available on the player's car to log their current names.

```lua
local car = ac.getCar(0)

for i = 0, car.carCamerasCount - 1 do
    local cam = ac.accessCarCamera(i)
    if cam then
        ac.log("Camera " .. i .. " FOV is currently: " .. cam.fov)
    end
end
```

</TabItem>
