title: setLogSilent
description: Controls whether log functions write to the physical log file on disk.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Determines if debugging functions such as
`ac.log()`, `ac.warn()`, and `ac.error()` should write their output to the physical log file on your drive.

## Usage Patterns

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Silence Logs">

Calling the function without an argument or with `true` stops disk writing.

```lua
ac.setLogSilent(true)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Enable Disk Logging">

Passing `false` restores default behavior, writing all log entries to the drive.

```lua
ac.setLogSilent(false)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Description

The `ac.setLogSilent` function is a performance and hardware safety utility.
Writing to a physical file on an SSD or HDD is a relatively slow operation compared to updating a UI element.
When you are debugging complex logic that prints multiple messages every frame,
the overhead of disk I/O has potential to cause noticeable stuttering or "lag" in the simulation.

By silencing the log, you can continue to use high-frequency logging for development while ensuring the simulation remains smooth.
This also helps prevent unnecessary wear on storage hardware during long development sessions.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type      | Required | Default | Description                                     |
| :-------- | :-------- | :------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `value`   | `boolean` | No       | `true`  | Whether logging to the disk should be silenced. |

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="High Frequency Debugging">

Silencing the log to safely monitor a variable that changes every frame.

```lua
-- stop writing to the physical file to save performance
ac.setLogSilent(true)

function script.update()
    local car = ac.getCar(0)
    -- this would normally spam the drive, but is now safe
    ac.log("Current Speed:", car.speedKmh)
end
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Conditional Logging">

Ensuring logs are only written to disk when a specific error state is met.

```lua
-- start silenced
ac.setLogSilent(true)

function checkSystem(status)
    if status == "CRITICAL" then
        -- re-enable disk logging so the error is saved for later review
        ac.setLogSilent(false)
        ac.error("Critical system failure detected!")
    end
end
```
