title: getCar
description: The primary function for accessing vehicle data in the simulation.
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Returns a reference to a car's state structure. This is the starting point for almost any script interacting with vehicles.

## Signature

```lua
ac.getCar(index)
```

## Description

This function provides access to the `ac.StateCar` object for a specific vehicle in the session. Vehicle indices are 0-based.

:::note[Indexing]
The player's car is always at index `0`. In multiplayer or races with AI, other cars will occupy indices `1` through `N`.
:::

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type      | Required | Default | Description                   |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `index`   | `integer` | Yes      | -       | The 0-based index of the car. |

## Return Values

| Type          | Description                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ac.StateCar` | A reference to the car's data. Returns `nil` if the index is invalid. |

## Technical Notes

- **Performance:** Calling `ac.getCar` is extremely cheap (it returns a pointer to a pre-allocated FFI struct). However, it is still best practice to cache the reference if you use it many times in a single loop.
- **Thread Safety:** In physics scripts, this data is updated at the physics rate. In UI scripts, it is updated at the frame rate.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Check Player Speed">

```lua
local car = ac.getCar(0)

if car.speedKmh > 100 then
    ac.log("Fast!")
end
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Iterate All">

```lua
-- it is usually better to use the iterator for multiple cars
for i, car in ac.iterateCars() do
    ui.text(string.format("Car %d: %s", i, car.driverName))
end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
