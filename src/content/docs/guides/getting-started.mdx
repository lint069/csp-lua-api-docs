Welcome to the **Custom Shaders Patch (CSP) Lua SDK**. This framework allows developers to extend Assetto Corsa's engine capabilities dynamically, ranging from custom UI overlays to completely new game modes, physics alterations, and rendering effects.

## What is this SDK?

**Assetto Corsa** is built on a proprietary engine by [Kunos Simulazioni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunos_Simulazioni). **Custom Shaders Patch** is a runtime hook, developed by [Ilja Jusupov](https://github.com/gro-ove), that injects modern rendering techniques and logic into that engine.

The **Lua SDK** is the bridge between the C++ CSP core and user-generated content. It utilizes **LuaJIT**, allowing code to run extremely fast within the game loop, be it via a physics frame or render frame.

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
    This documentation assumes you are proficient with **Lua** or **LuaJIT**.
    We do not cover syntax, loops, tables, or basic programming concepts here.
    If you are new to Lua, and are willing to learn, we recommend [Lua.org](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) or [Lua by Example](https://luabyexample.techplexlabs.com/).
    It is a scripting language, and arguably easier than Python, with less keywords.

## Architecture

### Script Types

| Type | Context | Description |

## Project Structure

A typical Lua App requires a specific folder structure to be recognized by Content Manager and CSP.

<FileTree>
- assettocorsa/
  - apps/
    - lua/
      - my_first_app/
        - **manifest.ini** (metadata and config) 
        - **my_first_app.lua** (entry point)
</FileTree>

<Aside type="caution" title="Naming">
    Note that your main Lua script needs to have the same name as the folder you've placed it in.
</Aside>

## Your First App

Let's create a simple "hello world" utility app to verify your environment is set up correctly.

<Steps>

1.  **Create the Folder**

    Navigate to your Assetto Corsa root folder, then to `apps/lua/`. Create a new folder named `hello_csp`.

2.  **Create the Manifest**

    Create a file named `manifest.ini`. This tells AC how to load your window.

    ```ini title="manifest.ini"
    [ABOUT]
    NAME = hello csp
    AUTHOR = YourName
    VERSION = 0.1
    DESCRIPTION = My first Lua app

    ; comments in .ini files are written like this,
    ; using a semi-colon ;

    [WINDOW_...]
    ID = main
    NAME = CSP WINDOW ; the name of this specific window instance
    ICON = icon.png
    FUNCTION_MAIN = windowMain ; this window instance's main entry point function
    SIZE = 200, 100 ; the size of the window in pixels
    ```

    If this is done correctly, an app named `hello csp` will show up automatically in
    Content Manager under `Content > Miscellaneous > Lua Apps`. If you then load into a driving session,
    expect to see an app named `CSP WINDOW` in the side bar, under all apps.

3.  **Write the Logic**

    Create `hello_csp.lua`, or whatever you set the name of the folder to. We will define the function referenced in the manifest (`windowMain`) and use the `ui` namespace.

    ```lua title="hello_csp.lua"
    -- this function is called every frame while the window is visible
    function script.windowMain(dt)
        ui.text("Hello, Assetto Corsa!")

        if ui.button("Click Me") then
            ac.log("Button was clicked!")
        end
    end
    ```

4.  **Launch and Test**
