This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a basic utility app. 

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
  Before starting, ensure you have:
  - **Content Manager** installed.
  - **Custom Shaders Patch**.
</Aside>
<Aside type="danger" title="Lua">
  This documentation assumes you are already proficient with **Lua** or **LuaJIT**. 
  
  The SDK is a professional toolset and does not cover foundational programming concepts.
  If you are new to the language, or to programming in general, it is strongly recommended to study the following resources before proceeding:
  - [Lua.org](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)
  - [Lua by Example](https://luabyexample.techplexlabs.com/)
</Aside>

## Project Structure

A typical Lua App requires a specific folder structure to be recognized by Content Manager and CSP.
Scripts that do not follow this hierarchy will not be loaded.

<FileTree>
- assettocorsa/
  - apps/
    - lua/
      - my_first_app/
        - manifest.ini <Badge text="Required" variant="danger" />
        - my_first_app.lua <Badge text="Required" variant="danger" />
</FileTree>

<Aside type="danger" title="Strict Naming Rule">
    The main Lua script **must** have the exact same name as the folder it is contained in.
    For example: `apps/lua/telemetry/telemetry.lua`.
</Aside>

## Hello World

Follow these steps to create a simple utility app with a functional button.
Read more on creating your first app [here](https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-lua-sdk/wiki/Lua-apps).

<Steps>

1.  **Create the Application Folder**

    Navigate to your Assetto Corsa root folder, then to `apps/lua/`. Create a new folder named `hello_world`.

2.  **Define a Manifest**

    Create a file named `manifest.ini`. This metadata file tells Assetto Corsa how to handle your window instance.

    ```ini title="manifest.ini"
    [ABOUT]
    NAME = Hello World
    AUTHOR = YourName
    VERSION = 1.0
    DESCRIPTION = My first Lua app

    ; write comments in .ini files with semi-colons

    [WINDOW_...]
    ID = main
    NAME = Your First Window
    ICON = icon.png
    FUNCTION_MAIN = windowMain
    SIZE = 300, 150
    ```

    <Aside title="Note on WINDOW_...">
        The `WINDOW_...` section allows you to define multiple windows for a single app.
        Each window can point to a different entry-point function in your Lua script.
    </Aside>
    <Aside type="tip">
        If this is done correctly, an app named `Hello World` will show up automatically in
        Content Manager under `Content > Miscellaneous > Lua Apps`.
    </Aside>

3.  **Write Logic**

    Create `hello_world.lua`. We will use the `ui` namespace to draw text and a button.

    ```lua title="hello_world.lua"
    -- this function is called every frame while the window is visible.
    -- the name matches 'FUNCTION_MAIN' in the manifest.
    function script.windowMain()
        ui.text("Hello, Assetto Corsa!")
        ui.separator()

        if ui.button("Click Me", vec2(ui.availableSpaceX(), 40)) then
            ac.log("The button was clicked at " .. ac.getSim().gameTime .. "s")
            ui.toast(ui.Icons.Confirm, "Action Triggered!")
        end
    end
    ```

    <Aside type="tip" title="Namespace Prefix">
        Note the use of `script.windowMain`.
        In CSP, your entry functions are usually defined as members of the global `script` table.
        More on that later.
    </Aside>

4.  **Enable and Launch**

    1. Open **Content Manager**.
    4. Launch a session.
    5. Expect to find an app named `Your First Window` in the side bar, under all apps.

</Steps>

## Debugging and Output

When developing, you need to see what is happening under the hood. CSP provides several ways to monitor your script.

### The Lua Debug App
While in a session, look for the **Lua Debug** app in the sidebar. This app provides:

- **Console Output:** View everything sent via `ac.log()` or `print()`.
- **Performance:** Monitor the CPU time used by your script.

<Aside title="Developer Apps">
    The Lua Debug app will appear under developer apps. If there is no subheading named Developer apps,
    that means you'll have to enable them. In Content Manager, navigate to `Settings > Assetto Corsa > System`.
    There will be a checkbox in the top-left for Developer apps, and you'll want to make sure it's checked.
</Aside>
<Aside type="tip" title="Live Reload">
    Most scripts will reload automatically when saving the file in your code editor.
</Aside>

### Real-time Watches
Use `ac.debug()` to track a value visually without spamming the log.

```lua
function script.update()
    local car = ac.getCar(0)
    -- creates a live updating entry in the Lua Debug app
    ac.debug("Current RPM", car.rpm)
end
```
