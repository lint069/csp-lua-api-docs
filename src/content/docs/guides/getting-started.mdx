This documentation assumes you are already proficient with Lua or LuaJIT.
The SDK is a professional toolset and does not cover foundational programming concepts.
If you are new to the language, or to programming in general, it is recommended to study the following resources before proceeding:

- [Lua.org](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)
- [Lua by Example](https://luabyexample.techplexlabs.com/)

This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a basic utility app.

## Project Structure

A typical Lua App requires a specific folder structure to be recognized by Content Manager and CSP.
Scripts that do not follow this hierarchy will not be loaded.

<FileTree>
- assettocorsa/
  - apps/
    - lua/
      - my_first_app/
        - manifest.ini <Badge text="Required" variant="danger" />
        - my_first_app.lua <Badge text="Required" variant="danger" />
</FileTree>

<Aside type="danger" title="Strict Naming Rule">
    The main Lua script must have the exact same name as the folder it is contained in.
    For example: `apps/lua/telemetry/telemetry.lua`.
</Aside>

## Hello World

Follow these steps to create a simple utility app with a functional button.
Read more on creating your first app [here](https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-lua-sdk/wiki/Lua-apps).

<Steps>

1.  **Create Application Folder**

    Navigate to your Assetto Corsa root folder, then to `apps/lua/`. Create a new folder named `hello_world`.

2.  **Define Manifest**

    Create a file named `manifest.ini`. This metadata file tells Assetto Corsa how to handle your window instance.

    ```ini title="manifest.ini"
    [ABOUT]
    NAME = Hello World
    AUTHOR = YourName
    VERSION = 1.0
    DESCRIPTION = My first Lua app

    ; write comments in .ini files with semi-colons

    [WINDOW_...]
    ID = main
    NAME = Your First Window
    ICON = icon.png
    FUNCTION_MAIN = windowMain
    SIZE = 300, 150
    ```

    <Aside title="Note on WINDOW_...">
        `WINDOW_...` lets a single app define multiple windows.  
        Each window can point to a different entry function in the Lua script.
    </Aside>

    <Aside type="tip">
        If configured correctly, an app named `Hello World` will appear in
        Content Manager under `Content > Miscellaneous > Lua Apps`.
    </Aside>

3.  **Write Logic**

    Create `hello_world.lua`. We will use the `ui` namespace to draw text and a button.

    ```lua title="hello_world.lua"
    -- this function is called every frame while the window is visible.
    -- the name matches 'FUNCTION_MAIN' in the manifest.
    function script.windowMain()
        ui.text("Hello, Assetto Corsa!")
        ui.separator()

        if ui.button("Click Me", vec2(ui.availableSpaceX(), 40)) then
            ac.log("The button was clicked at " .. ac.getSim().gameTime .. "s")
            ui.toast(ui.Icons.Confirm, "Action Triggered!")
        end
    end
    ```

    <Aside type="tip" title="Namespace Prefix">
        Entry functions are typically defined as members of the global `script` table.
    </Aside>

4.  **Enable and Launch**

    1. Open Content Manager.
    4. Launch a session.
    5. Expect to find an app named `Your First Window` in the side bar, under all apps.

</Steps>

## Debugging and Output

When developing, you need to see what is happening under the hood. CSP provides several ways to monitor your script.

### The Lua Debug App

While in a session, open the Lua Debug app from the sidebar. It provides:

- Console output via `ac.log()` or `print()`.
- CPU usage for each running script.

<Aside title="Developer Apps">
    The Lua Debug app is listed under `Developer apps`.
    If the section is not visible, enable it in
    `Content Manager > Settings > Assetto Corsa > System` by checking `Developer apps`.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Live Reload">
    Most scripts reload automatically when the file is saved in your editor.
</Aside>

### Real-time Watches

Use `ac.debug()` to track a value visually without spamming the log.

```lua
function script.update()
    local car = ac.getCar(0)
    -- creates a live updating entry in the Lua Debug app
    ac.debug("Current RPM", car.rpm)
end
```
