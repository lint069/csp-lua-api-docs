The Custom Shaders Patch (CSP) Lua API is a massive extension of the Assetto Corsa engine.
It allows developers to write high-performance logic that interacts with almost every system in the game,
from the way light bounces off a car's paint to the way AI drivers navigate a track.

<Aside type="note" title="About these Docs">
  This documentation is a community driven effort to catalog the numerous
  functions and types found within the SDK. It aims to provide a clear reference
  for developers wanting to get their hands dirty with the API.

## Behind the Patch

<Card title="Ilja Jusupov (x4fab)">
  The CSP Lua SDK is developed and maintained by Ilja Jusupov, also known as
  x4fab. As the lead developer of Custom Shaders Patch and Content Manager,
  Ilja transformed Assetto Corsa from a static 2014 racing simulator into a
  dynamic, modern platform. The Lua API is his solution for allowing the
  community to add features that would otherwise require access to the game's
  original C++ source code.

## Why Lua?

Assetto Corsa was originally built using C++ and Python. However,
Python in AC is limited to basic UI and some telemetry data. CSP introduces LuaJIT for several key reasons:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Performance">
    LuaJIT is significantly faster than standard Python, making it capable of
    running logic within the physics engine without causing lag.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct Memory Access">
    The SDK uses Foreign Function Interfaces to communicate directly to the
    game's memory, allowing for integration with the engine's core.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hot Reloading">
    Unlike C++ plugins, Lua scripts can be reloaded instantly while the game is
    running, drastically speeding up development time.
  </Card>

## What Can You Build?

The scope of the API is divided into several contexts. Depending on where your script is placed, you can create:

- Custom HUDs
- New Game Modes
- Physics Modifications
- Visual FX: Scripted lights, dynamic weather behavior, and animated track elements.

## Technical Foundation

<Steps>

1.  ##### Engine

    Assetto Corsa provides the base physics and rendering pipeline.

2.  ##### Hook

    CSP (Custom Shaders Patch) injects itself into the engine process.

3.  ##### Bridge

    The Lua SDK provides the bindings, the functions like `ac.getCar()`,
    that allow your Lua code to tell the C++ engine what to do.
