  name="physics.disableCarCollisions"
  params="carIndex, disable, applyToRemote"
/>

## References

import Ref from "@components/Ref.astro";

Returns an <Ref id="ac/objects/state-car" /> object which contains the physical
state of the car. Check out the <Ref id="primitives/vec3" label="3D Vector Reference" /> for math operations.
Also: <Ref id="ac/objects/state-sim" />. Provide an ID that doesn't exist and boom: <Ref id="invalid/path/test" />.
