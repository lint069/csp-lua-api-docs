<Aside type="note" title="No-op">
  This function does absolutely nothing at runtime. It is a no-op helper
  designed specifically for [EmmyLua](https://github.com/emmylua). It allows the
  editor to understand that a class table is also a constructor function,
  providing proper autocomplete and type-checking when writing `local myObj =
  MyClass()`.
