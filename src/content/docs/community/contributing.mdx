This guide describes the workflow and standards for contributing to the CSP Lua API Documentation.
It covers technical setup, repository structure, and documentation conventions.

<Aside type="note" title="Prerequisites">
  This project is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and
  [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/).
  Familiarity with Markdown (MDX) and basic Git usage is required.
</Aside>

## Technical Setup

Before you can contribute, you need to set up the documentation engine on your local machine to preview your changes.

<Steps>

1.  Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

    <Aside type="caution" title="PATH Environment">
    Both `node` and `git` must be available in your system `PATH`.
    Verify this by running the following commands in any folder to confirm all required tools are available:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v # bundled with nodejs
    git -v
    ```

    If any of the commands above are not recognized, your installation may not be
    correctly configured. Refer to the official installation documentation for
    `Node.js` or `Git` to ensure the tools are available on your system `PATH`.
    </Aside>

    <Aside type="note" title="Package Manager">
    Use `npm` when installing dependencies. Other package managers are not officially supported
    for this repository.
    </Aside>

    <Aside type="tip" title="Git Clients">
    [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) may be used instead of the command line if preferred.
    </Aside>

2.  Fork the repository on GitHub and clone it to your machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lint069/csp-lua-api-docs.git [name-of-folder]
    cd [name-of-folder]
    ```

3.  Use `npm` to install the required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    <Aside type="note">
    Installation time depends on your system and network speed,
    and on the size of the modules within `package.json`.
    </Aside>

4.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The site is typically available at `http://localhost:6969/csp-lua-api-docs/`.

    <Aside type="note" title="Local Preview">
    Astro may expose both local and network URLs:

    ```sh
    ┃ Local    http://localhost:6969/csp-lua-api-docs/
    ┃ Network  http://<local-ip>:6969/csp-lua-api-docs/
    ```

    Use either address to preview the site in a browser.
    </Aside>
</Steps>

## Repository Structure

All documentation content lives under `src/content/docs/`.
Each top-level directory corresponds to a namespace or documentation category.

When adding a new page, ensure it is placed in the correct directory.

<FileTree>
- src/
  - content/
    - docs/
      - ac/ <Badge text="Namespace" variant="tip"/>
        - enums/ <Badge text="Enumerations" variant="tip"/>
        - objects/ <Badge text="Structs and Objects" variant="tip"/>
      - io/
      - ui/
      - .../
      - .../
      - .../
      - primitives/ <Badge text="Primitive Types" variant="note"/>
      - community/ <Badge text="About Us" variant="note"/>
        - contributing.mdx <Badge text="This Page" variant="caution"/>
</FileTree>

<Aside type="caution" title="File Naming">
  Use `kebab-case` for all filenames (e.g., `get-car.mdx`, not `getCar.mdx`).
  This ensures URL consistency across different operating systems.
</Aside>
<Aside type="note" title="Directory Structure">
  Each directory under `docs/` corresponds to a namespace in the Lua SDK.
  For example, `ac.getCar` is documented under the `ac/` directory.

  Enumerations, objects, and FFI-backed structures belonging to a namespace
  are placed in subdirectories such as `enums/` or `objects/`.
</Aside>

## Documentation Standards

To maintain consistency across the API reference,
all pages must follow a standardized structure and writing style.

### Page Anatomy

Most API reference pages should follow this specific order.
If a section is not applicable (e.g., a function has no parameters),
it may be omitted, but the relative order must be preserved.
Do not reorder sections for stylistic reasons.
Consistency across pages is more important than individual preference.

<Steps>

1.  ##### Frontmatter

    Every page starts with a `YAML` block.
    The `title` should be the full Lua name (e.g., `ac.getCar`),
    and the `description` should be a concise summary of what it does.
    The `description` is what is presented along with embedded links.

2.  ##### Summary & Context

    A one- or two-sentence high-level explanation.
    Use `<Aside>` components here for critical warnings or version requirements.

    <Aside type="caution" title="Covering Information">
    Do not restate information that is obvious from the function name,
    preventing summaries like "`ac.getCar` gets a car".
    </Aside>

3.  ##### Usage Patterns

    Use `<Tabs>` to show the most common ways to call the function.
    This provides immediate value to the reader before they dive into any technical details.

4.  ##### Description

    A deeper dive into the behavior, logic, and edge cases.
    Prefer prose over bullet points here.

5.  ##### Parameters & Return Values

    Use standard Markdown tables to define inputs and outputs.
    Include types like `integer`, `number`, `string`, `vec3`, or links to custom objects.

6.  ##### Examples

    Practical, copy-pasteable code snippets using `<Tabs>` to categorize different use cases
    (e.g., "Basic Usage", "Advanced Logic").

</Steps>

### Writing Style

We write for a technically competent audience. Avoid "fluff" and conversational language.

- Write in a declarative, factual style.
<Aside type="note">
Use "Returns the car's speed" instead of "This function will return the speed of the car".
</Aside>
- Exclude lead-in labels.
<Aside type="note">
Do not start paragraphs with "Note:" or "Warning:". Use the appropriate `<Aside>` component instead.
</Aside>
- Do not explain how `if` statements or `for` loops work.
Assume the reader knows Lua and is here specifically for the CSP API.
- Use `backticks` for code symbols, function names, and variable names in prose.
- Avoid normative or opinionated language such as "should", "best", or "recommended" unless strictly required.

### Code Example Guidelines

Code examples are the most important part of the documentation.

- Show only the code necessary to demonstrate the specific API, avoiding large "scaffolding" code.
- Use realistic variable names, and scenarios that a user would actually encounter.
- Use comments sparingly to explain why something is happening, not what the Lua syntax is doing.

<Aside type="tip" title="Incomplete Pages">
If you are creating a page but don't have all the information yet,
add the "Incomplete" badge to the sidebar in the frontmatter:

```yaml
sidebar:
  badge:
    text: Incomplete
    variant: caution
```

Remove the badge once the page meets the documentation standards described here.
</Aside>
